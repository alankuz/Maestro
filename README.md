## The App for Music Teachers and Students

Welcome to the Maestro Git Hub Repo! Maestro is a full-stack web browser application built for music students and teachers. The app has been created to make communication between music teachers and students more efficient, effective, and accessible.

### How It Works

Maestro allows users to create two separate types of accounts, one for **teachers and one for **students. Each type of account allows the user access to different features within the app. 

***Teachers can use Maestro to help guide students thorugh practice routines remotely by uploading digital lesson materials into weekly modules, viewable by their students. Teachers can also track students' practice and progress and keep lesson schedules within the app using the Google Calendar API. 

***Students Can log in and access their posted practice routines from their teachers, organized into weekly modues, content being updated based on time in the program.
