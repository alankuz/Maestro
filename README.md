## Start Practicing Harder

Welcome to the Maestro Git Hub Repo! Maestro is a full-stack web browser application built to help music students have more accountability when it comes to practicing. The app intends to make communication between music teachers and students more efficient, effective, and accessible.

### How It Works

Maestro allows users to create two separate types of accounts, one for **teachers** and one for **students**. Each type of account allows the user access to different features within the app. 


***Students*** can log in and access their posted practice routines from their teachers and record how much time they spend practicing. 

***Teachers*** can use Maestro to help guide students thorugh practice routines remotely by uploading digital lesson materials which are made viewable by their students. Teachers can also track students' practice and progress and keep lesson schedules within the app.
